            <p>I started my journey in the world of computers from an young age,
            now Iâ€™m 23 years old, Pursuing my Masters Degree in
            MIET, Jammu University.  Web development is my center of interest, i always
            love the idea of cross-platform development, 1-n one code base deploy into almost
            any platform, which web technology like Javascript enables me to do. I also like
            creating Interactive UI components for better UX  and share those desgin and codes
            to the world through Github, Codepen.
